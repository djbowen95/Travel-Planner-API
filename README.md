# Travel Planner API
This is a mini-project developed around a brief provided by the University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Coding Bootcamp. it is a RESTful API in Node/Express that interacts with a MySQL database. The project was built in week 13 of the course - which focused on Sequelize and Object Data Mapping. Other than a seeder function (./seeds/) the project has been built from scratch.
